# RebelliousToken
The power of cryptocurrencies lies in the ability to print and distribute money without a central governing body (such as a government or bank). Unfortunately, most traditional cryptocurrencies are quickly dominated by investors with fat wallets and miners with plenty of hardware. 
We are Rebellious; we will take this power back and put it in the hands of a community focused on involvement rather than greed.
